Thanks for submitting a comment. All comments are moderated, so it might take a little while before seeing them.

Comments are statically generated and fetched using [PooleApp](http://pooleapp.com), an open source static commenting system that doesn't suck your information and throw it inside a tonne of algorithms to determine how you like to dress. 

Thanks to [Phil Hawksworth](http://hawksworx.com) and [Alfredo Aguirre](http://madewithbyt.es) for the commenting system! Awesome work!
