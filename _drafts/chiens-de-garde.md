title: Les Chiens de Garde (Watchdogs)

This book tells an odd tale: that we are subjects to watchdogs. It would seem ludicrous in today's democratic society to wonder about whether we are anybody's 'subjects'. The books that usually treat this are either historical accounts, or dystopian science-fiction (Animal Farm, Brave New World, 1984). Few of today's popular cultural products, outside of philosophy, treat of a _present_, active subjectification {% cite Guattari:1995te %}; the only that comes to mind is District 9 where we see a normal guy acting on the orders of his superiors that he desperately tries to accommodate. After all, he wants to be well-liked. This is what Watchdogs is about: an analysis of a caste completely unconcerned with the living conditions of its inferiors (or so they are deemed). Worse, these masses of inferiors must be channelled to productive uses (the superiors' productive uses, of course). This is my brief review. 

Why would a book from 1932, written by a 27 year old Paul Nizan, be of any interest nowadays? This quote helpfully replaces the book's central arguments to today (my translation):

> It is not in vain that the jury of teaching fellows only asks candidates about Ideas. The Idea of truth. The Idea of reality. The Idea of justice. The Idea of progress. the Idea of the State. Should it not be verified that these future professors are capable and willing to do their duty and reveal that which lay in shadows?

Nizan harshly criticises the philosophers of his time (the 1930s and before) which, he argues, acted as watchdogs to the production of knowledge and the attribution of meaning. To talk of Ideas in this way, to capitalise the concepts, is to give them an unquestionable quality. 

In some ways, the critique serves as a wakeup call, firstly, from a dependency on irrelevant philosophies so detached of the world of the common man; and secondly, in favour of a grounded engagement of philosophy that could provide realistic answers. 

Does this ring a bell in the current times? Citing Nietzsche in _The Dawn of Day_, {% cite Nietzsche:2012ta %}: 

> F. Nietzsche had already seen that a business-minded society had to flee the possibilities of living and thinking dangerously: "The Moral Code of conduct of a business-minded society---Behind this principle of the moral conduct: the moral actions are the actions of sympathy towards the others, I see dominate the social instinct of fear that disguises itself as an intellectual endeavour: this instinct poses as superior principle the most important and the most central, that it must be taken from life anything that is dangerous or was previously thought as dangerous, and that everyone should help, to the utmost of their strength, in this. Only those actions that aim towards general security and the sensation of security are those that can be qualified as good."
{% cite Nizan:2012ta -l 90 %}

Some interesting quotes (my translation):

> When the bourgeois ideas were seen as the productions of an eternal reason, when they had lost the staggering character of a historical production, they then got imbued with the greatest chance to survive and resist any assault. 
(Nizan 1932, p. 88)
