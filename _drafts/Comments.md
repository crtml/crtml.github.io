The presence of comments in blogs has become ubiquitous. When I first built this blog using Jekyll, as a static blog, it didn't have any commenting section. On top of being a new blog, being scarce with posts, this absence made it feel *empty*. So I set to find an alternative to the dynamic, Web 2.0 style of comments and found [Poole](pooleapp.com). [Poole is Jekyll's butler, which is a great name because it serves sites with static comments.] It is only after having installed the commenting sections that I asked mys	lf *why* comments would make a blog more alive, especially one in which I am not expecting any kind of participation. I call it he Web 2.0 withdrawal syndrome.

I have already had that syndrome, when I quit several social websites. I limited the number to what I saw was a minimum, and still feel they have too much grip on my life. Paradoxically, though, I also have the need to see the *possibility* of participation. What an empty, vain need. Should a blog have a commenting section, especially one which is not likely to foster that kind of community, if community at all? I have gone online and to my surprise saw a number of prolific bloggers and technologists who discarded with comments altogether. 

## State of Comments in High Profile Blogs
I have been to many of these blogs, and I had not realised it did not have comments sections (which is telling about the felt necessity to have them). But if the decision for me to allow comments on a blog or not is easy since there are no comments yet, it is much harder for those well-known blogs. I find their arguments surprising. Some authors completely forgoe comments.
