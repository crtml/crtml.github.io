I'm interested in researching the socio-technical movements that open source and free software create. These movements have a tendency towards being minoritarian in their conception of the software---there are no global monopoly in open source, only in parts of a project's code. Yet, the _idea_ of open source and free software is much more global and ubiquitous, and it enters in conflict with many aspects of our society, if we look at wider things, or the software projects themselves, if we look at narrower things.
