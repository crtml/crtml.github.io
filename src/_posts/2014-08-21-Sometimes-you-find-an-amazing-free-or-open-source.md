Sometimes, you find an amazing free or open source software that you think should be working very well, and is in fact, not so much. At least, not as it should. I've got two in mind. One is an online book (and publishing system, please let's have better sdk docs!) about typography; the other is a publishing system for academics. They both should work great, have a following, and make headway into institutions.

In the academic space, researchers are clinging on word documents which output the same, boring files. Granted, the publishers are partly to be blamed: they seldom accept anything which isn't a .doc file. Goodbye LaTeX! It's unfairly labouring if you want to use anything else than an expensive package that holds a monopoly over a closed formatting. That's where _Fidus_ comes in. Fidus is a web app which takes text and typesets it in PDF, HTML, or ePub. Makes sense right? Why should the writer worry about how every single element looks? This is the publisher’s job!

The other is a great little book with quick advice and context on typography. Yet only about 10% of the 700,000 visitors have left some money behind. It would not have had such publicity if not open source, but still, it’s sad it didn't get more. 

I don't blame so much the people, but the way to contribute to online---especially _libre_---content is not satisfactory. There are myriads of online paying systems, but none as open and transparent as should be. I imagine a little button somewhere in the front page that works like flattr in which a small and discretionary amount can be given. Even a pledge system would work well, where people pledge each month a small quantity to share among _libre_ content, with the money shipped after being given a chance to review and change the pledges. Set aside 10€ to share among your visits, give a little to Linux Mint, give a little to Fidus, give a little to a podcast. If every one who had spent a significant time on hoe typography website had payed a minuscule amount, the project would be much more successful. 

I wonder if the GNUs are doing something to facilitate this?
