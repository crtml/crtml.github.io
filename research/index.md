My PhD studies requirements in open source contexts. Specifically, it studies how requirements are handled and articulated.[^abstract]

[^abstract]: There is an old [abstract](http://www2.lse.ac.uk/management/research/phd-students/dcurtomillet.aspx) still drifting around.

I steer away from the usual conceptions of requirements as stable objects, and show how, even those requirements which seem largely accepted, can be questioned and discussed. By seeing requirements from this dynamic perspective, I challenge the established notion that requirements are tameable objects, rendered simple through an engineering process. In other words, requirements have an existential quality which allows them to evolve along with the project. This implies that requirements have a deep influence on what the project itself should become; the separation between the project and its requirements is not clear cut. The difficulty with requirements then, is not the processes that simplify them (turning them into use case descriptions, user stories or the like), but that, just like the project, they often resist these simplifications. 

Open source offers an interesting way to account for this existential evolution of requirements because there is usually no clear and definite, hierarchical decision (there is no typical omni-potent owner) as to what the final product or project should be. More often than not, open source projects are closer to evolutionary prototypes, which---though following a directive line---are not constrained by narrow intents. Instead, the projects try to be adaptive to their environments: they are open to learning about the field they are in and listening to its changing necessities. This does not mean open source projects have a better success rate or that they necessarily take better decisions, only that the processes put in place to cater to requirements tend to reflect this perpetual, dynamic movement. In other words, open source projects have the potential to realise better, more accurate and more innovative requirements, but it is only the potential to. 

## Interests
My research interests lay fundamentally in software studies and open source. Open source is a great way to theorise and challenge normative understandings of technology and its use because it escapes established explanations. There is always a hacker somewhere making something incredible that streamlined markets couldn't bother with or didn't value accordingly. I find the open source field one of incredible vitality and full of surprises. Open source has long tentacles and is much more ubiquitous in defining technology than is usually imagined.
