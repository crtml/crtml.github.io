<!-- My research focuses on two main tracks (see [publications](#publications) and [projects](#projects) for more information).

- (1) Alternative forms of production (e.g. open source, Free software, crowdsourcing, open innovation) and information systems development (ISD):

  - Theorising ISD in open source. Open source is often understood to be an alternative to 'traditional' development, but not theorising why that is limits how deeply we can study such development processes of software creation;
  - Understanding the impact of community interpretations of open source and what it means to them. How communities varyingly understand open source will influence the importance given to openness and how they will put it into practice. In turn, such interpretations will influence how they manage their software and community participation;
  - Researching open source requirements as organising artefacts. If, as extant research suggests, open source is often considered informal and indeterminate regarding requirements management, then what are the implications to the open source project organisation?;
  - Citizen-science and the creation of sustainable communities;
  - Sustainability in open source (see [current project](#current-projects));
  - Studying the community-side of open innovation. Most literature in open innovation is strategic and firm-oriented, theorising on the way that firms can appropriate external sources of knowledge. Little is known, however, about what's going on on the othe side.

- (2) Ethics of the alternative forms of production:

  - Developing stakeholder theory to account for the particularities of these forms of participation;
  - Offering a critique of the sharing economy from an information systems perspective;
  - Theorising the notion of well-being and happiness in the increasingly boundary-less contexts afforded by the alternative forms of production. -->
