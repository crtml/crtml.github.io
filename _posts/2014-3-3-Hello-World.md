title: Github (User-)Pages and Jekyll Now for Blogs

I had wanted to do this a long time ago, but had so little time. Finally,  thanks to the really simple [instructions](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) from Barry Clark, the developer behind [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), I can start blogging here already. Jekyll Now is an already built structure of Jekyll with template included, so just fork it and change it. It's really simple. Had thought of using [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/), and I will, but shall wait for the Raspberry Pi to arrive and build my new server first. 
The reason for doing this is the simplicity behind static sites. I was (am) getting fed up of the flurry of super, ultra, widgets in your face.

Thanks Barry! I can now read papers and do _my thing_.
