_Les Chiens de Garde_ by [Paul Nizan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Nizan)---Watchdogs in English---tells an odd tale: that we are subjects to watchdogs {% cite Nizan:2012ta %}. It would seem ludicrous in today's democratic society to wonder about whether we are anybody's 'subjects'. The books that usually treat this are either historical accounts, or dystopian science-fiction (_Animal Farm_, _Brave New World_, _1984_). Few of today's popular cultural products, outside of philosophy, treat of a _present_, active subjectification {% cite Guattari:1995te %}; the only that comes to mind right away is the movie _District 9_ where we see a normal guy acting on the orders of his superiors that he desperately tries to accommodate. After all, he wants to be well-liked. This is what _Les Chiens de Garde_ is about: an analysis of a caste completely unconcerned with the living conditions of its inferiors (or so are they deemed). Worse, these masses of inferiors must be channelled to productive uses (the superiors' productive uses, to be precise). This is my brief review of the book. 

## Re-actualisation

Why would a book from 1932 [[^book]], written by a 27 year old Paul Nizan, be of any interest nowadays? This quote helpfully contextualises the book's central arguments to today (my translation):

> It is not in vain that the jury of teaching fellows only asks candidates about Ideas. The Idea of truth. The Idea of reality. The Idea of justice. The Idea of progress. The Idea of the State. Should it not be verified that these future professors are capable and willing to do their duty and reveal that which lay in shadows?
{% cite Nizan:2012ta -l 79 %}

Nizan harshly criticises the philosophers of his time (the 1930s and before) which, he argues, acted as watchdogs to the production of knowledge and the attribution of meaning. To talk of 'Ideas' with a big I, to capitalise the concepts, is to give them an unquestionable quality, a universal value that holds always true. The problem, according to Nizan, is that those values reflect necessarily those who are responsible for their production (and enjoyment): the _bourgeois_. Although the term _bourgeois_ has lost a lot of weight since the events of May 68, it is still used widely, only in other forms. More contemporary terms would be the '1%' from Occupy Wall Street, the 'elites', the 'wealthy' (from Piketty's essays). This conception of the _bourgeois_ as both responsible for a society's moral compass and the one who enjoys the fruits of that morality, is still very much with us. 

## The Productive _Bourgeois_

The problem with this _bourgeois_ control over the production of knowledge and meaning is a concentration of the valuation (and the values themselves) of things, of what is right and wrong, by those who profit themselves directly from the production. Citing Nietzsche in _The Dawn of Day_, Nizan presents this argument more forcefully (again, my translation) {% cite Nietzsche:2012ta %}. 

> F. Nietzsche had already seen that a business-minded society had to flee the possibilities of living and thinking dangerously: "The Moral Code of conduct of a business-minded society---Behind this principle of the moral conduct: the moral actions are the actions of sympathy towards the others, I see dominate the social instinct of fear that disguises itself as an intellectual endeavour: this instinct poses as superior principle the most important and the most central, that it must be taken from life anything that is dangerous or was previously thought as dangerous, and that everyone should help in this to the utmost of their strength. Only those actions that aim towards general security and the sensation of security are those that can be qualified as good."
{% cite Nizan:2012ta -l 90 %}

Does this ring any bells? It seems this quote has not aged a bit. Nizan (and Nietzsche as well) do not claim that we should live dangerously in the physical sense, but that there is censorship over ideas simply because a handful of (powerful) people deem it 'dangerous'. This is right inside Orwell's _1984_ territory, where dangerous words are wiped from the vocabulary, and therefore, human consciousness. 

Some other ideas, though, seem to have aged quite a bit. For example, Nizan is quite wary of the State, which is strange to hear from a 1930's communist. According to him, the philosophers are the State's clerical staff responsible for the reproduction of its political thought. It is their doing, their teaching which maintains the common man oppressed (or suppressed?). Today's communists, instead, postulate themselves as defenders of public institutions, especially the schooling system. But Nizan seems to argue in favour of private entrepreneurship to impart educational material, far removed from the State's hands and its potential power of manipulation. 

This is where Nizan makes a forceful point: we have to be wary of concentrations of power---in some way, just as economics should be wary of monopolies---especially in those areas which concern the production of ethical values. On these values, and the way they are produced, depend further productions. It is this point which is most concerning: the worlds seems to converge around larger entities whose ethical pursuits are not clear. In the IT world, tech giants are buying companies left, right and center; the media are part of a few conglomerates owned by extremely wealthy people [[^presse]]; the universities are ever more dependent on public finances which are increasingly controlled and subject to bureaucracies which limit their emancipation; the Internet and the Web are sliding dangerously from citizen hands. Once dusted off a bit, Nizan's words ring too true. A sad state of affair indeed.

## A Critique of the Role of Philosophy and Sociology

What to do according to Nizan?  Nizan almost specifically dedicates a chapter to this. His work affects the way research should, according to him, be carried out. He comes to argue for a closer link with the common men, and how they come into being. He questions their knowledge and the sources of their views, the positions they find themselves in and the possibilities they have to escape their situation. He asks that research be close to those that suffer, those that have little force to make their voices heard in a very phenomenological fashion (my translation):

> We have to ask every man how he perceives the elements of his life: his activity, his joy, his sadness all lay on top of this perception. We then have to look for the sources of his perception, if it were born from a direct experience or whether it is an idea harped on by some teacher who is stranger to his life. 
{% cite Nizan:2012ta -l 131 %}

This experience echoes Zuboff's work when questioning the introduction of the computer in various industrial and service-oriented sectors {% cite Zuboff:1989ul %}. Nizan, equally, would have been worried about the space given to people and how the expectations from the elites would have influenced them *and* their thinking processes. In some way, both these works are an up-ending of the traditional values of Taylorism: both try to render visible the changes and the obstacles to those that Taylorism made invisible. For Zuboff, those were workers in the industry, treated as automatons; for Nizan, those that were told that all was well and were never listened to. These, sadly, have remained unseen except in that research which made the effort to go look for them, those *othered*, rendered strangers by those more powerful. 


## Conclusion

In the last chapter, Nizan gets carried away. Perhaps too much the fruit of his time---he dreamt of revolutions---and so the tone sounds somewhat naive now that we can look back at the events that promised so much freedom and delivered too few. Yet, his analysis of the situation remains true despite the 80 or so years that separate the first edition from the newest one. Despite the grim situation of an economically depressed Europe, there is hope in an energised citizenship, concerned about its role and participation in democracy.

In some ways, the critique serves as a wakeup call, firstly, from a dependency on irrelevant philosophies so detached of the world of the common man; and secondly, in favour of a grounded engagement of philosophy that could provide realistic answers. 


Some interesting quotes (my translation):

> When the bourgeois ideas were seen as the productions of an eternal reason, when they had lost the staggering character of a historical production, they then got imbued with the greatest chance to survive and resist any assault. 
(Nizan 1932, p. 88)
