I read a lot of books, so I care a lot about how they are written. Sometimes, the writing is bad, and sometimes the writing is good. The writing is not everything though, and a few times, it is the editing which is bad. Here are some examples of terrible editing. 
The first example baffles me particularly. 

![L'existentialisme est un humanisme](/images/post-images/sartre_existentialisme.png)

This passage is taken from the French edition of *Existentialism is a humanism* by Jean-Paul Sartre. It comes from the collection *Folio essais*, which I assumed specialised in short essays until I saw that Simone de Beauvoir's *Le deuxième sexe*---a rather large book---was part of that same collection. What could possibly warrant such a small text column? The two column design starts from good intentions: to summarise the paragraph's idea to allow the reader a cursory glance once he has read the book. 

The problem is that it makes the main text impossible to read! It's frustrating to to go down a line so fast. And some of the summaries are not really interesting (some are titled 'an example'). Another reason for this design is to make the book small enough and accessible to act as a manifesto, in a way similar than Strunk and White's *The elements of style*. But why not make the book bigger then? 

It's not the only version of the book available. In French, as well, was a 1970 edition that had a much larger main text. I suppose this one was accepted by Sartre (the *Folio essais* version was published in 1996, well after the author's passing). The Folio series are usually (literally) pocket sized book, and that is generally a great idea, but not always. Some books are too lengthy to comfortably read in that format; the small size is only camouflaged by the large depth that makes it impractical. 

Another example of publishing that is usually disliked by some colleagues is Law's and Mol's book *The body multiple*:

Notice, at the bottom, the text with a sans-serif font? The main text is accompanied by a sort of guide explaining the conditions of the investigation and the methodology taken. On each page, these two texts are displayed. 

I actually like it. The problem for some is that the two texts don't talk about the same thing, or are not directly related. Personnally, I prefer it that way; had it been directly complimentary, I would have felt obliged to read both at the same time. Not here, I just casually glance at the text on the bottom, keep calm, and carry on. Perhaps it's because I tend to read books slowly, or like getting distracted. But frankly, it has guts to try something like this, acting as a practical analogy of the multiple in the text which follows its own lines and directions. 

There are lots of books that just re-print---even with an old type-writer font. I don't mind so much, but there is no evolution. Most of these books, for example, don't provide an index. St a time when books are competing with articles (and losing ground to them), it's sad so little effort is made to keep them floating.

Compare the left page from the right&#8230; Look for the p's especially&#8230; The font seems to have been washed away, it's barely readable as it is. But the publisher is the French university presses holding many important texts written by professors. Even their recent financial difficulties doesn't add up: this is the 12th edition! My guess is that the same image of the original edition (1968) has been used, and that's it. It hasn't changed at all from the first one---bugger all the typesetting advancements! It's just a pity, especially compared to American or British university presses which seem to make a big effort in making their books easy to read. 

Perhaps I'm making a fuss and the typewriter font from the French university press does have some charm. But why leave the poor print quality?
