I study **information systems from a social science perspective**. My main research interests are in alternative forms of participation such as **open source studies**, **open innovation**, **citizen science**, the **collaborative economy**, and how these influence **information systems development**. I am currently a [**Marie Curie Research Fellow**](http://cchs.csic.es/en/user/4030) at the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) and remain affiliated to the UAM--Accenture Chair at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid in the School of Economics and Business Studies. Previously, I helped write the European Union-funded proposal _Stars4All_ to the CAPS2020 call of the H2020 programme. I also served as a Research Fellow for that project and was responsible for developing structures and processes to create sustainable and participative citizen-scientist communities. Blub.

I have an MEng in computer science from University College London (UCL), an MSc in information systems (LSE), and a **PhD in information systems and innovation from the London School of Economics (LSE)** completed in 2015.
